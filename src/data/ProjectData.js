        description: "As a Fresher into Web world I started learning web technology, learned a basic standard language - HTML, So I decided to develeop a basic project using HTML. Later on I styled it with CSS for a good looking, So by looking my pretty decent project not that good but it make me to do more on this project. I further learned JavaScript to do some basic logical actions in my site. After a long while I noted that these websites should also be coded in responsive, I  dont't think that i should code for responsive too, that's were I got to know Bootstrap, It made my work a lot easier to do so.",

        description: "As a developer I learned Advanced Java concepts like swings, servlets etc.. during my academics. So i got a idea why wont i develop a application using these, so I moved further and started implementing a application for food ordering. Customers can choose their favourite food from the list shown and can proceed to checkout, as a result they will receive bill and it will be stored in mysql workbench using Java-JDBC. Also thers is a seperate module to manage user account details, user can also reset their account password incase if needed.",

        description: "As a self-motivated learner I thought of learning Django for developing Fullstack Web Applications, So i created this full stack Jewellery Sales application. Users can register if they are new else can view the website by logging in, based on the available products users can pre-book jewells by paying for the item, indeed I used razorpay for making payments which will reflect in Admin bank accounts. There is a seperate module for admin to add jewells, manage placed orders, etc ...Django provides security middlewares to handle form submissions and more .. It supports SQLlite DB for backend.",

As a progression I developed this portfolio just to showcase my works and skills. Developing using react was a bit harder than I thought because it was a total different than developing using HTML. I also added EmailJS service for receiving mail and sending automatic reply's for those who have contacting me. ",

So I started developing Website using Ejs, NodeJs, MongoDB, Bootstrap etc .. At first it seems not much harder but as of time moved on developing in backend side became a tricky part. It's a bit tricky to manage user logged in sessions in database and to auto-logout after some time. Atlast I developed a full stack website and It is live.",
